This is an app that finds the 10 hottest cities within 30 miles of a given city in the US. Made for [MindSumo challenge](https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/build-a-weather-tool-to-help-travelers-find-hot-spots) from Kayak.

You can see the running app here: http://hotspots.herokuapp.com/

(Unfortunately the key I'm using often reaches above the query limit, so it's likely the above app does not work. Anybody have any Weatherbug keys they want to donate??)
